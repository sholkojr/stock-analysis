# Analysis of Select Clean Energy Stocks between 2017-18

## Objective

To perform an analysis of select clean enery stocks with opening, closing and trade volume data from 2017 and 2018.  A tool was developed in VBA for the client to quickly summarize the data to understand profit/loss and trading volumes of the stocks for both years and to enable the client to perform further analysis with more data.

## Results

### Development of the Analysis Tool

The tool was developed by creating variable arrays to add up the volume and determine the opening and closing price of each stock ticker. Each loop would test to see if the ticker name had changed (signalling the first stock entry and opening price) or was going to change (signalling the last stock entry and closing price) and would total the volume traded between the opening and closing entry in the data.

The summarized data would then be automatically displayed in a table generated by the VBA Code.  Buttons were inserted to provide a handy interface to run the scripts to generate the results.
